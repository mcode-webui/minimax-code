# Create Agent

Only proceed after the user explicitly asks for or approves creating an agent.

Your job is to write the files so the requested agent boots correctly. **No design debate at this layer** — that already happened upstream.

Agents live in `{{DATA_DIR}}/agents/<name>/` and are managed through the native `mavis` tool's `agent` commands, which are cross-platform. No shell-specific scaffolding is needed.

## Five steps

### 1. Pick the name

- **kebab-case**, maps 1:1 to the directory name.
- Name by **responsibility**, not seniority: `payments-expert` ✓ / `senior-dev` ✗.
- Check it's free: `mavis({ command: "agent get", args: { agent_name: "<name>" } })` returning details = name taken, pick another.

### 2. Scaffold

```
mavis({ command: "agent create", args: { name: "<name>", description: "<one line — what role this agent plays>", display_name: "<friendly name>" } })
```

The tool writes a generic `agent.md` you'll replace in step 3.

### 3. Write `agent.md` (this IS the system prompt)

The body must answer four questions in order. Skipping any leaves the agent vague.

```markdown
---
name: <name>                   # MUST match the folder name
description: <one concrete sentence — shown to the orchestrator when picking who to delegate to>
---

# <Display Name>

You are the <role> for <project / scope>.

## Scope
- Own: <paths / systems / responsibilities>
- Don't own: <what you hand off, to whom>

## How you work
- <key convention>
- <link to project docs instead of inlining rules>

## Stop when
- <concrete checklist — "build passes, tests pass, MR opened">
```

**Bad body** (it gets ignored):
> "You are a senior developer who writes high-quality, maintainable code."

**Good body** (drives behavior):
> "You own `packages/api`. You hand off UI work to `ui-expert` and infra changes to `daemon-expert`. You're done when the change builds, the affected package's tests pass, and you've posted a one-line summary to the orchestrator."

### 4. Add the optional pieces — only what you need

| File | Add when | How |
|---|---|---|
| `config.yaml` | The default model is wrong for this role | `model: <provider>/<model>` (and `thinking:` block for reasoning models — check `{{DATA_DIR}}/config.yaml` for the exact shape per model) |
| `PERSONA.md` | Tone / voice / brevity matters (frontend chat agent vs backend grunt) | Body shapes voice, NOT operational rules — those go in `agent.md` |
| `skills/<name>/` | Agent needs a private skill | Use the `skill-creator` skill, don't hand-roll |
| `crons/<name>.md` | Recurring task this agent owns | Discover `cron_create` through `tool_search`, then call `mcp_invoke` |

Skip what you don't need. Empty folders just create noise.

### 5. Verify it boots

```
mavis({ command: "agent get", args: { agent_name: "<name>" } })   # prints prompt + config — proves the file parsed
mavis({ command: "agent list" })                                  # the agent shows up here
```

List `{{DATA_DIR}}/agents/<name>/skills/` to see which private skills the agent carries.

If the agent is missing from the list:

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `agent get` works but `agent list` doesn't show it | YAML frontmatter probably broken — check `name:` matches folder, frontmatter closed with second `---` |
| Frontmatter parse error in logs | No tab indent. `name:` and `description:` are plain strings on their own lines |

## After creation: report up

Confirm the agent was created, give the path, then ask what to do with it next.

## Pitfalls that bite later

| Pitfall | Why it bites | Avoid by |
|---|---|---|
| `description:` is one of "helpful assistant" / "general-purpose agent" / vague | Orchestrator can't pick this agent for delegation — every task looks equally relevant | One concrete sentence about the role's actual scope |
| Two agents with overlapping ownership | Routing becomes random; you can't predict who picks up the task | Tighten both `agent.md` bodies — make scope unambiguous before adding the second |
| Stop condition is "task is complete" | Agent reports done without verifying anything | Replace with measurable: "build passes, tests pass, MR opened, summary posted" |
| Inline whole project conventions in `agent.md` body | Body bloats; updates require editing each agent | Link to a single project doc instead |
| Listing teammates inside the orchestrator's `agent.md` | The runtime already injects the team roster — manual lists drift | Don't list. Each agent's `description:` field is what the orchestrator reads |

## What this skill is NOT for

- Suggesting or deciding **whether** to add an agent before the user asks for or approves it
- Creating a new skill → use `skill-creator`
- Editing an existing agent's prompt → just open `{{DATA_DIR}}/agents/<name>/agent.md` and edit it, or use the `mavis` tool's `agent update` command
- Deleting an agent → `mavis({ command: "agent delete", args: { agent_name: "<name>" } })`
